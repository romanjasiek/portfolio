# Portfolio

This Portfolio is a React re-creation of my previous Portfolio (`GitHub page`: https://romanjasiek.github.io/photo_project / `GitHub repo`: https://github.com/romanjasiek/photo_project).

All in all I spend `100+ hours` in building it.

`Version: 0.2.2`

## What I did here:

First, I watched an online video tutorial on `Udemy` (https://www.udemy.com/course/css-und-sass/) which covered `HTML` and `CSS` (including `Sass/SCSS`) and had a total running time of 37 hours.

After watching it and finishing the project I modified the project to include `Font Awesome` and `Bootstrap`, both locally. And then I implemented a very basic `lightbox` for the gallery images.

And then I started a new `Create-React-App` project and tried to recreate my Portfolio as a `React` app.

Well, this is the result so far.

## What I still have to do here:

- Redo the `lightbox`
- More `mobile optimizations`
- Fixing the `sidebar navigation`
